### Intrinsic Robustness

This subdirectory contains code to incorporate AGT in ensembles to improve intrinsic robustness guarantees.

`batch_moons_multi_sample_comparison.ipynb`: Demonstrates how multi-sample analysis outperforms per-sample analysis for ensembles trained with AGT.

`agt_moons_script.py`: Runs ensembles trained with AGT with different ensemble sizes.

`batch_moons_agt_comparison.py`: Generates visualisation for naive DPA vs naive FA vs DPA+AGT

`batch_moons_agt_rob_acc.ipynb`: Visualises accuracy-robustness tradeoff for ensembles with different fractions of members trained with AGT (DPA)

`batch_moons_agt_rob_acc_fa.ipynb`: Visualises accuracy-robustness tradeoff for ensembles with different fractions of members trained with AGT (FA)

`show_graph.ipynb`: Visualises nominal,certified accuracies and R values trends with varying ensemble sizes
